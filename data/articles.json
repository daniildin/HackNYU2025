Meanwhile, the hyperscalers with great balance sheets held up much better than the ones with strained balance sheets,\" he said. \"Just keep in mind that things change very fast in the AI space, so what was true last month might not necessarily stay true this month or next year.\"\n\nHe pinpointed a difference in the performance of AI companies linked to OpenAI — like Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft and AMD — and those affiliated with Alphabet — such as Broadcom and Celestica. He said latter cohort has seen a boost as some investors start to favor the newest iteration Gemini over ChatGPT. Wall Street Street at large is also growing concerned about OpenAI's massive spending commitments, Cramer continued.\n\nHyperscalers with strong balance sheets are starting to pull ahead, he continued, noting that companies like Alphabet, Meta and Amazon have the capacity to keep spending big on AI. However, Cramer added, Oracle, CoreWeave and Nebius have more strained balance sheets.\n\nBut he warned that the AI space is volatile and said it's possible another platform will surpass Gemini. Cramer also said he doesn't want to \"paint with too broad of a brush here.\" For example, he noted that Nvidia got hit over worries about newfound competition and its ties to OpenAI. However, the AI giant also just reported a blowout quarter with strong guidance and demand for its products still exceeded supply, he continued.\n\nThe diversification of the AI trade is a good thing, Cramer suggested, saying it's positive that investors are starting to think more critically about which of these companies \"deserves to be winners.\"\n\n\"In general, I think it's actually pretty healthy. I'm never going to root against higher stock prices,\" he said. \"But there was always something unsettling about the entire AI cohort rallying in lockstep.\"\n\nClick here to download Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.\n\nSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.\n\nDisclaimer The CNBC Investing Club holds shares of Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft and Broadcom.\n\nQuestions for Cramer?
